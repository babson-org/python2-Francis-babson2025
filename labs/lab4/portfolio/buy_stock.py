    - Fetch last-close price via _prices.get_last_close_map([sym]) (use this price to buy shares)

    - IMPORTANT: in self.positions there should only be one dictionary per symbol

    - Add the purchase to an existing position or create a new position in self.positions 
    - Be sure to decrease the client cash attribute
